This cut-down example of using Rsyslog in containers was prepared in response to
a conversation in the following issue report:

    https://github.com/rsyslog/rsyslog/issues/2159

First build the container, something like:

    cd /path/to/directory
    docker build --tag rsyslog-logger .

To run the container, you'll need to do something like:

    docker run --env RSYSLOG_LOGGING=on rsyslog-logger

If you want to use the log forwarding, you will need to change the domain
in `config/papertrail/rsyslog.conf` either to a valid Papertrail domain, or to
another FQDN of your choice. You can get a free account from https://papertrailapp.com/
to test this.

You'll also want to change the input directives too. I've added my current ones
to give a flavour of how I am (mis)using Rsyslog. These are implemented as a set
of on-host volumes, and they are written by a variety of other containers.
